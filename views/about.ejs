    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Nagaraju</strong>, a passionate web developer with a background in Computer Science Engineering.</p>

    <p>I have over <strong>5 years of experience</strong> in the IT industry, where I've contributed to building scalable and user-focused web applications.</p>

    <p>My core strengths lie in full-stack JavaScript development. I work extensively with <strong>React.js</strong> for front-end interfaces and <strong>Node.js with Express</strong> on the backend.</p>

    <p>I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving my skills to stay up to date with the latest technologies.</p>

    <p>This site is my personal space to share thoughts, projects, and experiments in web development.</p>

    <p class="fw-semibold">Thanks for stopping by!</p>
